# Hi there, IÂ´m Daniel!


Working as a data scientist, I developed projects related to customer retention (churn and customer score), use of telemetry data to define vehicle usage patterns to improve the customer experience.
The tools I currently use most are Python and SQL in environments such as Databricks, Oracle, Hue (Hive SQL), Spark (Databricks) and Machine Learning frameworks.
I am currently trying to incorporate Rust into the deployment of large-scale machine learning models.
